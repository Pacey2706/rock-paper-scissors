# ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS, LIZARD, SPOCK
![pre-view of project](assets/images/responsive.png)
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a website containing a game from the beloved show "The Big Bang Theory".
The site is aimed towards fans of the show and people who would would like to play a more complex game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. In the game your opponent is a fully automated computer who picks one of the options at random.

## Design Decisions 
The two main colours used for the site are Black and white for a clear contrast, and a clean, crisp layout, that is easily viewable by users with diminished visibility or accessibility challenges.
Green and Red font colours have been used for a win and lose score tally.
The images used are simple and perfectly represent the choices made by the user and computer.
